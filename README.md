# Family Tree

This project is a **family tree** implemented in **Prolog**. It defines family relationships using **facts and rules** and allows users to query different relationships using Prolog's logical inference system.

## Features

- Define relationships such as **parent, child, sibling, grandparent, and greatgrandparent**.
- Use Prolog rules to infer relationships dynamically.
- Query family connections through logical reasoning.
